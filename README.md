# Deep Topology Classification

This repo contains code and datasets for the IEEE Big Data 2016 paper entitled - " Deep Topology Classification: A New Approach for Massive Graph Classification". It provides a feed forward neural network model for the classification of complex graphs based upon their feature vectors.

## Requirements

This code has been tested on Python 2.7.5+ and requires the following packages to function correctly:
* numpy 
* scipy
* graph-tool
* scikit-learn 
* tensorflow
* keras
